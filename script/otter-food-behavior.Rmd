# chunks

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Data

```{r, cache=TRUE}
otter_data <- read.csv("../data/Bowden-ParryOtterdata.csv")
head(otter_data)
```


## Analysis

What food do the otters prefer more; trout, mussels, or crab?
using the columns of data, foodtype, totalbeg and begreceived.
making begreceived to be > 0 to exclude trials that did not receive food when they wanted it.
making the totalbeg > 0 so I could see if the otters wanted that food or not.

```{r}
begging <-   
  otter_data %>%
  filter(begreceived > 0, totalbeg > 0) %>% 
  select(foodtype, totalbeg, begreceived)

knitr::kable(head(begging))
```
