## Question

- What food do the otters prefer more; trout, mussels, or crab?
- Do they Share the same food they beg the most for?


## Analysis 1

```{r, echo=FALSE}
begging <-   
  otter_data %>%
  filter(begreceived > 0, totalbeg > 0) %>% 
  select(foodtype, totalbeg, begreceived)

knitr::kable(head(begging))
```



## Food preference

```{r}
ggplot(begging, aes(x = begreceived, y = totalbeg, color = foodtype)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(size = 2, width = 1, height = 1)
  
```


## what does that mean?

 - mussels
 - crab 
 - trout





# Analysis 2 

```{r}
sharing <- 
  otter_data %>% 
  filter(begreceived > 0, sharingbybegonly > 0) %>% 
  select(begreceived, sharingbybegonly, foodtype)

knitr::kable(head(sharing))
```


# was the food shared 

```{r}
ggplot(sharing, aes(x = begreceived, y = sharingbybegonly, color = foodtype)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_jitter(size = 2, width = 1, height = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~foodtype)
  
```


## What?

Did the otters share the food they begged the most for?
 - yes
 - also shared the food the begged theleast for
