Questions:
What food do the otters beg for the most; trout, mussels, or crab?
Do they Share the same food they beg the most for?

General plan for upcoming weeks: 
Creating histograms or plots to single out what food the otters are begging for the most, then seeing how often they share each food by using more plots. 
Interpreting the data and explaining the importance 
Finding and inserting pictures of otters 
Answering any questions from classmates and making sure its in my data
